<h1 align="center">üß† Predictive Modelling of Psychological Distress Using Daily Thought Patterns: A Novel Supervised Machine Learning Approach üß†</h1>

This repository contains the full pipeline for classifying psychological distress using Random Forest models trained on daily ongoing thought patterns, derived from experience sampling (Ho et al., 2020). The distress dimensions follow the DASS-21 framework and include:

- **Depression**  
- **Anxiety**  
- **Stress**  
- **Overall Psychological Distress (DASS Total)**  

Classification is implemented in two forms:

- **Binary Classification:**  
  *Normal* vs *Severe*  

- **Multiclass Classification:**  
  *Normal*, *Mild*, *Moderate*, *Severe*, *Extremely Severe*
### (Cutoffs based on Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995; Gavrilescu & Vizireanu, 2019)

## üìÅ Project Structure

### üîπ **Binary/**
## üéØ Goal

Classify psychological distress into two categories ‚Äî **Normal (0)** and **Severe (1)** using daily ongoing thought features.

## üìÇ Directory Structure

### `Preprocessing/`
- Cleans and prepares the dataset
- Applies binary classification thresholds
- Splits data into **balanced train/test sets**
- Uses `Corrected_Unscaled_thought_personality_combined.csv` as input

### `FinalData/`
- Contains final processed **training** and **testing** datasets

### `BinaryAnalysis.ipynb`
- Complete **machine learning pipeline** for binary classification
- Includes model training, evaluation, and interpretation

### `Results/`
- Stores model **outputs**, **performance metrics**, and **visualizations**

## üîπ FiveClassesDefault/

### üéØ Goal

Perform **five-class classification** of psychological distress based on DASS-21 subscales:

- `0` = Normal  
- `1` = Mild  
- `2` = Moderate  
- `3` = Severe  
- `4` = Extremely Severe  

---

## üìÇ Directory Structure

### `Preprocessing/`
- Applies predefined **DASS-21 cutoffs** (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) to all subscales
- Splits data into **balanced train/test sets**

### `FinalData/`
- Contains **preprocessed multiclass datasets** for training and evaluation

### `FiveClassClassification.ipynb`
- Main notebook implementing the **multiclass classification workflow**
- Includes training, evaluation, and SHAP-based model interpretation

### `Results/`
- Stores **model performance metrics** and **visualizations** (e.g., confusion matrices, SHAP plots)
